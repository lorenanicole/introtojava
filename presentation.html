# Introduction

### My name is Lorena Mesa

### Why are you here today?

# Coderpad - an online REPL

REPL - Read, evalulate, print, loop

Online REPLs allow us to use Java without having to install it on your local machine (for now)

To start:

* Navigate to `http://coderpad.io`
* Select `try demo` => `Java`
* Look -- some prepopulated code, a `Solution` class!
* Hit `run >` to execute the code!

# Java

Static, strongly typed

```Java
int age = 5;
String name = "Maru";
bool isFluffy = true;
```

Sometimes these [two can be confused](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/121385/what-are-the-key-aspects-of-a-strongly-typed-language), for example Python is a dynamic strongly typed language

Static languages use known types, these types are checked at run time as shown above

In Java the [compiler will check for these type of errors](http://www.sitepoint.com/typing-versus-dynamic-typing/) rather than at run time

Strongly typed indicates that the types for objects change, while strong vs weak is more a spectrum we say Java is [strongly typed](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20563433/different-between-static-and-dynamic-programming-languages)

# Let's create a variable

Just like Algebra when we'd solve for a variable `x` and used a variable to represent a value, we use variables in programming

(For those of you that have coded this is no surprise!)

To create a variable in Java, we opt to use `camelCase` for variable names, opting for lowercase to start 

Now that we know Java is a static programming, we know we need to define the type of variable too

# Java Primitives

Like any language, Java has [built in primitives](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

Primitives are the most basic built in data types, there are 8 of them

Here are a few examples of Java primitives:
```java

char example = 'a'; // single 16-bit Unicode character
int exampleTwo = 3; // minimum value of -231 and a maximum value of 231-1
long exampleThree = 9999999; // minimum value of -263 and a maximum value of 263-1
float exampleFour = 9.02; // 32-bit 754 floating point
double exampleFive = 333.10; // 64-bit 754 floating point
bool exampleSix = false;
```

---

# You try

Inside the `main` function (between the `{ ... }`) of the `Solution` class create the following:

1. Create an `int` variable with the value of the `date` today times the value of the `year`
2. Create a `bool` variable 
3. Create a `double` variable with the value of `pi` modulo the number of pies you ate on pie day! (Mar 14)

As you'd expect, you can do math with `int`, `double`, `float`, `long`!

*What happens if you try to multiple the `int` variable from 1 with the `bool` variable with 2?*

This is an example of Java's strong typing!
---

# But wait, we only have a `char` to work with?

You may have noticed that a `char` is only a single Unicode character

Primitives don't let us do much in Java, they allow us to do math operations but if we want to do other things we will need to use objects

Primitives can be "[autoboxed](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html)" into an object using a [primitive wrapper class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_wrapper_class)

A class wraps up a primitive's data along with methods to let you do things with the data and carry the data in one object, all objects in Java descend from the `java.lang.Object` [class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html) 

```java
int oldInt = 8;
Integer newInt = Integer.valueOf(oldInt);
newInt += oldInt;
System.out.println(newInt); // What do you think the value is?
```
---

# You try

Inside the `main` function (between the `{ ... }`) of the `Solution` class create the following:

1. Create an `int` variable with the value of your `age`
2. Wrap the primitive `age` with a primitive wrapper (*Which one should we use and why?*)
2. Create a `<what type ?>` variable with the value of your `name`
3. `System.out.println` a message with your `age` and `name`

---
# You try

1. Create an `int` variable with the value of your `age`
2. Wrap the primitive `age` into the primitive wrapper to make the `int` a text
2. Create a `String` variable with the value of your `name`
3. `System.out.println` a message with your `age` and `name`

```Java
int age = 29;
String newAge = String.valueOf(age);
String name = "Lorena";

System.out.println(name + " is " + age);
```

Primitives use less memory than objects, therefore "prefer primitives to boxed primitives" as Joshua Bloch advises in [Effective Java](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Edition-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683)
